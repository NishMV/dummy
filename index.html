        <p>Christopher Edward Nolan CBE (born 30 July 1970) is a British and American filmmaker. Known for his Hollywood blockbusters
             with complex storytelling, Nolan is considered aleading filmmaker of the 21st century; his films have grossed $5 billion worldwide.
              The recipient of many accolades, he has been nominated for five Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards 
            and six Golden Globe Awards. In 2015, he was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in 
            the world by Time, and in 2019, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his contributions to film.

            Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, 
            he made several short films before his feature film debut with Following (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, 
            Memento (2000), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He transitioned from independent 
            to studio filmmaking with Insomnia (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with The Dark Knight trilogy (2005–2012),
             The Prestige (2006) and Inception (2010); the last of these earned Nolan two Oscar nominations—Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. 
             This was followed by Interstellar (2014), Dunkirk (2017), Tenet (2020) and Oppenheimer (2023). For Dunkirk, he earned two Academy 
             Award nominations, including his first for Best Director.

            Nolan's work regularly features in the listings of best films of their respective decades. Infused with a metaphysical outlook, 
            his films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. 
            They feature mathematically-inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, 
            large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother Jonathan, and runs the
             production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.
